                        IT Capstone is a year-long course run by QUT that pairs
                        teams of students with real life clients to do a project
                        for them. Students are expected to manage the projects
                        independently and submit project management reports as
                        expected of a real life IT project.

                        My team was tasked with developing a 3D reconstruction
                        of a dental procedure for two doctors from the Royal
                        Women’s Hospital in Brisbane, despite no one on the team
                        having any prior skills in developing 3D models or
                        animation in Blender, we received a High Distinction for
                        the course.

                        The project involved constructing an anatomically
                        accurate 3D model of teeth, jaw, gums, nerves and muscle
                        tissue, then animating the removal of the wisdom tooth
                        for the purpose of educating graduate dental students.

                        was my responsibility.

                        Mathematics Capstone was the final course of the
                        mathematics portion of my degree, where students were
                        split into teams and tasked with developing a
                        mathematical model for TNC, a for profit nature
                        conservatory company.

                    <li>
                        The nature of the project is to assess and model the
                        viability of funding intact forest landscapes of PNG
                        using static and dynamic modeling techniques.

                        I was able to gain experience with treating and
                        extracting large amounts of raw data as well as applying
                        static and dynamic optimisation techniques to the
                        extracted data.
